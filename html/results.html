    <div class="row explanation">
        So, what happened?  Well, in the first game the computer decided based on <span class="important">Ethical Egoism.</span>  This means the computer wants to act for its own self intrest only.  So, the computer keeps a record of all the moves it ever made and looks at what moves gave it the shortest prison sentence regardless of what happens to the other person.  That means if players visiting the site consistantly choose to <span class="important">Remain Silent</span> the computer will notice and <span class="important">Betray</span> to get away with 0 years of prison time.  As a result of this behavor this computer for the first game is dynamic and will change over time as a result of the people who visit this site.
        <br><br>
        In the second game you played against a computer who based their decisions on <span class="important">The Social Contract Theory.</span>  That states that "The right thing to do is to follow the rules that rational, self-interested people would agree to follow for their mutual benefit."  So, the computer will always choose to <span class="important">Remain Silent</span> because it believes that is best rule for both players to follow.
